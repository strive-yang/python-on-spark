# python-on-spark
This is a program of big data students. I will study spark from 0 to 1.  Wishing me the opportunity to become a big data expert soon.

These contents mainly focus on learning the basics of Spark, including Spark Core and Spark SQL. In the future, we will learn about Spark Millib and others. Most of the code will run locally, while some will run on the cluster yarn.
